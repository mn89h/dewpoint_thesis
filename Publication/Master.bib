The radiative energy from the lamp absorbed at different depths in the laboratory tank, as well as the possible temperature effects, have been calculated. The results demonstrate that in the laboratory more than 50 \% of the infrared radiation is absorbed within the upper 0.01 mm, more than 90 \% within the upper 0.1 mm, and more than 99 \% within the upper 1 mm, and that evidently most of the heat energy in the surface layer is quickly transported away by other physical processes.},

  abstract = {Despite the pervasiveness of the idea that arthritis is influenced by the weather, scientific evidence on the matter is sparse and non-conclusive. This study, conducted in the Australian inland city of Bendigo, sought to establish a possible relationship between the pain and rigidity of arthritis and the weather variables of temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed and precipitation. Pain and rigidity levels were scored by 25 participants with osteoarthritis and/or rheumatoid arthritis four times per day for 1 month from each season. Mean pain and rigidity scores for each time of each day were found to be correlated with the meteorological data. Correlations between mean symptoms and temperature and relative humidity were significant (P {$<$}0.001). Time of day was included in the analysis. Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that meteorological variables and time of day accounted for 38\% of the variance in mean pain and 20\% of the variance in mean rigidity when data of all months were considered. A post-study telephone questionnaire indicated 92\% of participants perceived their symptoms to be influenced by the weather, while 48\% claimed to be able to predict the weather according to their symptoms. Hence, the results suggest (1) decreased temperature is associated with both increased pain and increased rigidity and (2) increased relative himidity is associated with increased pain and rigidity in arthritis sufferers.},

  abstract = {Relative humidity is usually measured in aerological observations and dew point depression is usually reported in upper-air reports. These variables must frequently be converted to other moisture variables in meteorological analysis. If relative humidity is converted to vapor pressure, most humidity variables can then be determined. Elliott and Gaffen reviewed the practices and procedures of the US radiosonde system. In their paper, a comparison of the relative errors was made between the saturation vapor pressure formulations of Tetens (1930), Goff-Gratch (1946), Wexler (1976), and Buck (1981). In this paper, the authors will expand the analysis of Elliott and Gaffen by deriving several new saturation vapor pressure formulas, and reviewing the various errors in these formulations. They will show that two of the new formulations of vapor pressure over water and ice are superior to existing formulas. Upper air temperature data are found to vary from about +50 C to \{minus\}80 C. This large variation requires a saturation vapor pressure equation to be accurate over a large temperature range. While the errors introduced by the use of relatively inaccurate conversion equations are smaller than the errors due to the instruments, dewpoint coding errors, and dewpoint conversion algorithms (Elliott and Gaffen, 1993); they introduce additional systematic errors in humidity data. The most precise formulation of vapor pressure over a plane surface of water was given by Wexler (1976). The relative errors of Tetens` (1930) formula and one due to Buck (1981) (Buck`s equation is recommended in the Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 3, 1991) are shown. The relative errors in this table are the predicted value minus the Wexler value divided by the Wexler value.},

Studies have shown that about 70\% of the staff at Swedish offices, schools and kindergartens experiences that the air is too dry during the winter season. Studies show that the relative humidity in indoor environments influences the incidence of respiratory infections and allergies. Important factors for the air environment indoors is to limit the number of airborne particles, since these are conveyors of both bacteria and viruses, and to keep the humidity at a level above 40\% and below 70\%, making the survival of viruses and bacteria minimized. Measurement results show that there is significant difference in the relative humidity during the winter season between the mechanically ventilated buildings with relative humidity levels below 10\% than in buildings with natural ventilation. An important issue is how human health is affected by during longer periods and during much of the day live in environments with low relative humidity. Several researchers have noted that the incidence of respiratory infections increase during the winter when people are exposed to long periods of low humidity indoors. This means that the consequences of low humidity in the indoor environment should be considered and evaluated in a completely different way than is done today.},

Humid indoor conditions also favour the growth of fungi indoors. About 60\% of all cases of newly diagnosed house dust mite asthma are due to a heavy exposure to house dust mites caused by high indoor humidities. Preventive measures are reduction of the indoor generated water vapour and higher ventilation rates. The size of the latter should not be fixed, but be adapted to keep indoor humidities so low that the growth of allergens is not favoured.},

  abstract = {The effect of the Knudsen layer in the thermal micro-scale gas flows has been investigated. The effective mean free path model has been implemented in the open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, to extend its applicability up to slip and early transition flow regime. The conventional Navier-Stokes constitutive relations and the first-order non-equilibrium boundary conditions are modified based on the effective mean free path, which depends on the distance from the solid surface. The predictive capability of the standard `Maxwell velocity slip---Smoluchwoski temperature jump' and hybrid boundary conditions `Langmuir Maxwell velocity slip---Langmuir Smoluchwoski temperature jump' in conjunction with the Knudsen layer formulation has been evaluated in the present work. Simulations are carried out over a nano-/micro-scale backward facing step geometry in which flow experiences adverse pressure gradient, separation and re-attachment. Results are validated against the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) data, and have shown significant improvement over the existing CFD solvers. Non-equilibrium effects on the velocity and temperature of gas on the surface of the backward facing step channel are studied by varying the flow Knudsen number, inlet flow temperature, and wall temperature. Results show that the modified solver with hybrid Langmuir based boundary conditions gives the best predictions when the Knudsen layer is incorporated, and the standard Maxwell-Smoluchowski can accurately capture momentum and the thermal Knudsen layer when the temperature of the wall is higher than the fluid flow.},

The sources and impact of the gases most frequently sensed by optical methods are listed. Three non-absorption-based and nine absorption-based methods and their main applications are then described in detail. Brief concluding comments are drawn. Findings All manner of optical gas sensing techniques have been commercialised and while the majority are absorption-based, several other methods also play a significant role. Some optical gas sensors offer advanced capabilities such as remote monitoring, the creation of 2D and 3D distribution maps, detection of parts per trillion levels and even the visualisation of gases in real time. They play a vital role in protecting workers from hazardous gases, controlling and minimising air pollution and monitoring the atmospheric environment, as well as being used in the food, medical, process, power generation and other industries. Originality/value This paper provides a detailed insight into optical gas sensing techniques and their uses.},

Leaf temperature, irradiance, and ambient carbon dioxide and oxygen partial pressures were kept constant. Net carbon dioxide uptake rates decreased linearly with increasing vapour pressure difference, even in cases where transpiration rates were highest at intermediate values of vapour pressure difference. Decreases in net carbon dioxide uptake rates were quickly reversible. Different wind speeds across the measured leaf, different vapour pressure deficits around the rest of the shoot, and transient responses of net carbon dioxide uptake rate to abrupt changes in vapour pressure difference all gave the same response of net carbon dioxide uptake rate to vapour pressure difference. The data show that the inhibition of net carbon dioxide uptake rate at a given vapour pressure difference was not simply related to whole leaf transpiration rate or stomatal conductance.},

This paper presented a comprehensive survey of TECT to show a complete foundation on the thermoelectric applications in electronic cooling. Thermoelectric physical parameters, consisting of Seebeck coefficient S, thermal conductivity K, and electric resistance R, are highly dependent on temperatures of thermoelectric heating and cooling sides and they have been simplified into constants when the thermoelectric cooling model was theoretically established. Furthermore, two systematical solution methodologies were proposed, i.e., the thermal resistance network and the effectiveness-number of transfer units, to describe the coefficient of performance (COP). Effects of cooling load, air temperature and all thermal conductances in heating side on the cooling performance have been attempted, regarding surface temperature of electronic devices and COP as evaluation indexes. Our analysis reveals that thermal control for electronics of high heat flux could be achieved by enhancing heat transfer in the hot side of thermoelectric system and increasing the numbers of thermoelectric coolers. Overall, governing parameters and modeling for practical applications have been presented, and the cooling potential of thermoelectric technology for electronic devices could be enhanced further.},

  abstract = {Although ubiquitous in nature and industrial processes, transport processes at the interface during evaporation and condensation are still poorly understood. Experiments have shown temperature discontinuities at the interface during evaporation and condensation but the experimentally reported interface temperature jump varies by two orders of magnitude. Even the direction of such temperature jump is still being debated. Using kinetic-theory based expressions for the interfacial mass flux and heat flux, we solve the coupled problem between the liquid and the vapor phase during evaporation and condensation. Our model shows that when evaporation or condensation happens, an intrinsic temperature difference develops across the interface, due to the mismatch of the enthalpy carried by vapor at the interface and the bulk region. The vapor temperature near the interface cools below the saturation temperature on the liquid surface during evaporation and heats up above the latter during condensation. However, many existing experiments have shown an opposite trend to this prediction. We explain this difference as arising from the reverse heat conduction in the vapor phase. Our model results compare favorably with experiments on both evaporation and condensation. We show that when the liquid layer is very thin, most of the applied temperature difference between the solid wall and the vapor phase happens at the liquid-vapor interface, leading to saturation of the evaporation and the condensation rates and the corresponding heat transfer rate. This result contradicts current belief that the evaporation and condensation rates are inversely proportional to the liquid film thickness.},

The humidity sensor is a capacitive type sensor. The structure of the humidity sensor consists of interdigital electrodes and a sensing film. The sensing film, which is polyimide, is coated on interdigital electrodes. The humidity sensor changes in capacitance when the sensing film absorbs or desorbs water vapor.

This paper presents a technology review of water vapor sensors and manufacturing techniques. Micromachining, more commonly known as MEMS or microelectromechanical systems, is an enabling technology based upon standard semiconductor manufacturing. MEMS technology makes possible solid-state sensors with greatly reduced power consumption and low operating voltage that are fully compatible with digital electronics and can be manufactured in high volumes at low cost. A water vapor microsensor just becomes another part on the circuit board. A "technology roadmap" for water vapor microsensors is defined where the sensing technologies have been organized into four major transduction schemes: capacitive, mass-sensitive, optical and resistive. Sensing element type, key geometric features and excitation scheme provides further classification. Operating principles and general performance characteristics are also presented.},

The SnO2 nanowires were synthesized via a colloidal process that employing SnCl4 ethanol solutions mixed with oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OLA). The spin-coating method was chosen to deposit the sensitive film at room temperature without high-temperature sintering. Furthermore, the Cu(NO3)2 methanol solution was used to remove the organic long chains coated on the surface of the colloidal SnO2 nanowires and expose more adsorption sites. The characterizations of the material were studied by means of FTIR, XRD, and FE-SEM. The saturated salt solution method was used to investigate the humidity sensing performance (response, recovery, repeatability, etc.) of the QCM sensor in the range of 11\%--97\%. The results showed that the sample with 12\,h synthesis has the best humidity response. This may be attributed to the larger specific surface area which makes the material provide more adsorption sites for water molecules, and more (110) planes formed which could absorb more water molecules proved by the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation.},

The FPH record from Boulder, Colorado, is the longest continuous stratospheric water vapor record. The instrument has an uncertainty in the stratosphere that is {$<$} 6 \% and up to 12 \% in the troposphere. A digital microcontroller version of the instrument improved upon the older versions in 2008 with sunlight filtering, better frost control, and resistance to radio frequency interference (RFI). A new thermistor calibration technique was implemented in 2014, decreasing the uncertainty in the thermistor calibration fit to less than 0.01 {$^\circ$}C over the full range of frost -- or dew point temperatures (-93 to +20 {$^\circ$}C) measured during a profile. Results from multiple water vapor intercomparisons are presented, including the excellent agreement between the NOAA FPH and the direct tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer (dTDLAS) MC-PicT-1.4 during AquaVIT-2 chamber experiments over 6 days that provides confidence in the accuracy of the FPH measurements. Dual instrument flights with two FPHs or an FPH and a cryogenic frost point hygrometer (CFH) also show good agreement when launched on the same balloon. The results from these comparisons demonstrate the high level of accuracy of the NOAA FPH.},

  abstract = {Abstract The influence of land surface heterogeneity on potential cloud formation is investigated using relative humidity as an indicator. This is done by performing numerical experiments using a large-eddy simulation model (LES). The land surface in the model was divided into two patches that had the same sum of latent and sensible heat flux but different Bowen ratios to simulate heterogeneous land surfaces. For heterogeneity in the meso-{$\gamma$} scale (2--20 km), sensitivity analyses were carried out on the heterogeneity amplitude (Bowen ratio difference between contrasting areas) and the inversion strength of potential temperature and specific humidity. The competition between absolute temperature decrease by ABL growth and dry air entrainment in heterogeneous conditions is analyzed using the LES results. First, it is shown that entrainment is located and enhanced over patches with higher Bowen ratios (warm patches) than their surroundings (cold patches). The heterogeneity-induced strong thermals can further penetrate the inversion at the ABL top, thereby reaching lower absolute temperatures than in homogeneous conditions. Second, because of the heterogeneity-induced circulations the moisture is located over the warm patch, and higher time-averaged RH values at the ABL top (RHzi) than over the cold patches are found here, even for dry atmospheres. These RHzi exceed values found over homogeneous land surfaces and are an indication that surface heterogeneity may facilitate cloud formation. In vertical profiles of RH, few differences are found between the homogeneous and heterogeneous cases, but the essential heterogeneity-induced modifications are within the domain variability.},

However it was in the late 20th century that we developed a wide range of smart technologies for detection and started to take advantage for our benefit. Today IR detector technology is in its 3rd generation and comes with challenging demands. Based on the propagation of IR radiation through free space it is divided into different transmission windows. The most interesting for thermal imaging are the mid-wave IR (MWIR) and the long-wave IR (LW IR). Infrared detectors for thermal imaging have a number of applications in industry, security, search \& rescue, surveillance, medicine, research, meteorology, climatology and astronomy. Currently high-performance IR imaging technology is mainly based on epitaxially grown structures of the small-bandgap bulk alloy mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT), indium antimonide (InSb) and GaAs based quantum-well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs), depending on the application and wavelength range. However, they operate at low temperatures requiring costly and bulky cryogenic systems. In addition there is always a need for better performance, which generates possibilities for developing new technologies. Some emerging technologies are quantum dot infrared photodetectors (QDIPs), type-II strained layer super-lattice, and QDIPs with type-II band alignment. In this report a brief review of the current and new technologies for high performance IR detectors, will be presented.},

Optical detectors also fall under two categories: point detectors that merely detect light intensity and two-dimensional detectors including position sensors and image sensors. In general, optical detectors utilizing the external photoelectric effect are represented by photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and exhibit fast time response and high sensitivity. Optical detectors using the internal photoelectric effect, such as photodiodes (PDs) and photoconductive cells, offer a wide spectral response range, compact size, and easy operation.},

The corrosion initiation is highly localised and associated with pores or micro-defects in the Au layer. The corrosion initiates by the dissolution of the underlying Ni layer, being less noble than Au. The dissolution propagates in lateral and perpendicular directions relative to the surface in an elliptical fashion. With time, the direction of corrosion propagation changes to a predominantly lateral attack of the Ni layer. The corrosion process is governed by the cathode/anode ratio of the Au/Ni galvanic couple.},

At the molecular level, evaporation requires breaking at least one very strong intermolecular bond between two water molecules at the interface. Despite the importance of this process the molecular mechanism by which an evaporating water molecule gains sufficient energy to escape from the surface has remained elusive. Here, we show, using molecular dynamics simulations at the water-air interface with polarizable classical force field models, that the high kinetic energy of the evaporated water molecule is enabled by a well-timed making and breaking of hydrogen bonds involving at least three water molecules at the interface, the recoil of which allows one of the molecules to escape. The evaporation of water is thus enabled by concerted, ultrafast hydrogen-bond dynamics of interfacial water, and follows one specific molecular pathway.},

Despite the fundamental nature of the underlying pressure gradients, the majority of studies on these emerging phenomena have been primarily empirical. Using classical nucleation theory and Becker--D{\"o}ring embryo formation kinetics, here we calculate the pressure field for all possible modes of condensation and desublimation in order to gain fundamental insight into how pressure gradients govern the behavior of dry zones, condensation frosting, and frost halos. Our findings reveal that in a variety of phase-change systems the thermodynamically favorable mode of nucleation can switch between condensation and desublimation depending upon the temperature and wettability of the surface. The calculated pressure field is used to model the length of a dry zone around liquid or ice droplets over a broad parameter space. The long-standing question of whether the vapor pressure at the interface of growing frost is saturated or supersaturated is resolved by considering the kinetics of interdroplet ice bridging. Finally, on the basis of theoretical calculations, we propose that there exists a new mode of frost halo that is yet to be experimentally observed; a bimodal phase map is developed, demonstrating its dependence on the temperature and wettability of the underlying substrate. We hope that the model and predictions contained herein will assist future efforts to exploit localized vapor pressure gradients for the design of spatially controlled or antifrosting phase-change systems.},

  abstract = {Aiming at solving the problem of atmospheric humidity measurement, a new dew point sensor using quartz crystal without frequency measurement has been developed. The sensor is composed of the Peltier module and the quartz crystal. When active condensation begins to occur in the quartz crystal surface, the electrical characteristics of the quartz crystal will change. Consequently, the oscillation characteristics of the resonant circuit containing the quartz crystal will also change. Hence, the oscillation characteristics change can be used to identify the time of condensation. The cessation of oscillation was measured, due primarily to signal attenuation caused by dew formation. This method uses the sensitive properties of quartz crystal but with no frequency measurement and also exploit the stability of the circuit. The sensor we have developed has fast response time and recovery time, especially with excellent dehumidifying performance. The accuracy of the dew point sensor when compared with the MICHELL S4000 dew point meter is found to be {\textpm}0.3{$^\circ$}C DP in the range of -20{$^\circ$}C to 20{$^\circ$}C DP. The low-cost sensor is easy to carry and has certain corrosion resistance.},

  abstract = {Water vapor condensation is a ubiquitous process in nature and industry. Over the past century, methods achieving dropwise condensation using a thin ({$<$}1 {\textmu}m) hydrophobic ``promoter'' layer have been developed, which increases the condensation heat transfer by ten times compared to filmwise condensation. Unfortunately, implementations of dropwise condensation have been limited due to poor durability of the promoter coatings. Here, thin-film condensation which utilizes a promoter layer not as a condensation surface, but rather to confine the condensate within a porous biphilic nanostructure, nickel inverse opals (NIO) with a thin ({$<$}20 nm) hydrophobic top layer of decomposed polyimide is developed. Filmwise condensation confined to thicknesses {$<$}10 {\textmu}m is demonstrated. To test the stability of thin-film condensation, condensation experiments are performed to show that at higher supersaturations droplets coalescing on top of the hydrophobic layer are absorbed into the superhydrophilic layer through coalescence-induced transitions. Through detailed thermal-hydrodynamic modeling, it is shown that thin-film condensation has the potential to achieve heat transfer coefficients approaching {$\approx$}100 kW m-2 while avoiding durability issues by significantly reducing nucleation on the hydrophobic surface. The work presented here develops an approach to potentially ensure durable and high-performance condensation comparable to dropwise condensation.},

Due to these reasons, there are field failures and reliability concerns of electronic assemblies-component disconnection which lead to overall malfunction of electronic assemblies. The novel ENIG achieves robust solder joints and provides improved quality and reliability of electronic assembly. Also, it uses cyanide-free chemistry for the immersion gold process making it eco-friendly. This allows manufacturers to consume eco-friendly product while avoiding major field failures and resulting consequences. With conventional ENIG, the immersion gold process operates on galvanic displacement process (displacing Ni atoms by Au atoms). If not controlled properly, the displacement can be aggressive leading to Ni corrosion, commonly known as "black pad" or hyper-corrosion of Ni. This leads to brittle solder joints failures. Also, during the reflow process the gold layer dissolves into solder and intermetallics form between tin and nickel. In conventional ENIG intermetallics, too much nickel diffuses into tin leaving behind soft Ni3P layer at the interface. This soft layer is responsible for brittle solder joints failures. The novel ENIG employs an interfacial engineering approach which leads to 10X corrosion resistance of Ni surface helping to prevent black pad/hyper-corrosion. Also, it creates a barrier for Ni atoms to diffuse too much in tin forming distinct-thin intermetallics which are robust and eliminates brittle solder joints failures. Ball Shear and Ball Pull tests (Industry Standard Based testing: JESD22-B115 \& JESD22-B117) have been conducted after (1, 3 and 6) reflow cycles during the soldering process. Also, as a part of simulating aging and evaluating long term reliability of solder joints/electronic assemblies, samples were subjected to 150{$^\circ$}C for 500 hours and 1000 hours before conducting Ball shear test and Ball Pull test. The novel ENIG board surface finish achieves robust solder joints for better reliability of electronic assemblies.},

Kw({$\lambda$}) can be related to the inherent optical properties of pure water, in particular the total absorption coefficient aw({$\lambda$}) and the molecular scattering coefficient bm({$\lambda$}), by means of equations derived from radiative transfer theory. We present an analysis showing that limiting values of Kw({$\lambda$}) can be estimated from aw({$\lambda$}) and vice versa. Published aw({$\lambda$}) data, which show discrepancies much larger than their estimated accuracies, are briefly reviewed and then compared, via our analysis, with Kw({$\lambda$}) data (our own new and previously published data as well as relevant data of others). This comparative analysis and new data allow a consistent and accurate set of optical properties for the clearest natural waters and for pure fresh water and saltwater to be estimated from 300 to 800 nm.},

This fog presence detector (FPD) offers an inexpensive alternative to visibility monitors and other specialized fog or cloud microphysical instruments that have typically been used for these purposes. The FPD utilizes a VCNL4200 proximity sensor (Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.), which operates as an infrared backscatter detector and was intended to detect proximity in cars, buildings, and personal electronics. An FPD with six individual sensors was evaluated in the field from 19 August 2019 through 4 November 2019. Over the course of the study, the FPD was able to distinguish between foggy and clear conditions. The output values from the individual sensors closely tracked one another and were strongly correlated with extinction coefficient measurements from a collocated visibility monitor. However, the study revealed that a more powerful, external infrared emitting diode (IRED) was necessary for reliable fog detection when sunlight was present. With the inclusion of an external IRED, the agreement between the FPD and visibility monitor averaged 91\% when indicating the presence of fog during fog events. Both the FPD and visibility monitor were found to be susceptible to insects and spider webs located in or near the optical sensing volume during foggy and non-foggy periods.},

Semiconductor lasers are now preferred over gas and solid-state lasers due to their wide tuning rage, high wall plug efficiency, compactness, low cost, and reliability. Unlike gas lasers there is a strong dependence of the local refractive index on the carrier density in semiconductor lasers, which affect mode discrimination and beam quality severely in a diode laser. For modern semiconductor laser designs, improved crystal quality meant reduced propagation losses and decreased thermal resistance as the lasers could now be made thinner, broader, and longer without compromising on the crystal quality. Modern semiconductor lasers use variants of the SCH design and the active regions are generally undoped. Recombination of injected carriers resulting in spontaneous emission is a major route to carrier loss in semiconductor lasers.},

This guard cell response to CO2 acclimatizes to the environmental conditions on the transfer of plants between the two environments. In the present study, air relative humidity is identified as a key environmental factor mediating the changes in stomatal sensitivity to CO2. In the greenhouse environment, elevation of relative humidity to growth chamber levels resulted in an enhanced CO2 response, whereas a reduction in the light level to that comparable to growth chamber conditions had no effect on stomatal CO2 sensitivity. The transfer of plants between humidified and normal greenhouse conditions resulted in an acclimation response with a time-course matching that previously obtained in transfers of plants between greenhouse and growth chamber environments. The high stomatal sensitivity to CO2 of growth chamber-grown plants could be reduced by lowering growth chamber relative humidity and then restored with its characteristic acclimation time-course by an elevation of relative humidity. Leaf temperature was unchanged during this restoration, eliminating it as a primary factor in the acclimation response. Humidity regulation of stomatal CO2 sensitivity could function as a signal for leaves inside dense foliage canopies, promoting stomatal opening under low light, low CO2 conditions.},

The deterministic relationship between the dew point and humidity is the basis for the industry-standard ``chilled-mirror'' dew point hygrometers used for highly accurate humidity measurements, which are essential for a broad range of industrial and metrological applications. However, these instruments have several limitations, such as high cost, large size and slow response. In this report, we demonstrate a compact, integrated photonic dew point sensor (DPS) that features high accuracy, a small footprint, and fast response. The fundamental component of this DPS is a partially exposed photonic micro-ring resonator, which serves two functions simultaneously: 1) sensing the condensed water droplets via evanescent fields and 2) functioning as a highly accurate, in situ temperature sensor based on the thermo-optic effect (TOE). This device virtually eliminates most of the temperature-related errors that affect conventional ``chilled-mirror'' hygrometers. Moreover, this DPS outperforms conventional ``chilled-mirror'' hygrometers with respect to size, cost and response time, paving the way for on-chip dew point detection and extension to applications for which the conventional technology is unsuitable because of size, cost, and other constraints.},

Depth sensing of human body motions can promote intuitive gesture inputs for natural HMI (Human Machine Interface) as well as HRI (Human Robot Interaction) to the next level. In today's industry, the dominant trends in 3-D depth sensing are shifting from the traditional laser based scanning or TOF (Time of Flight) depth sensing to the intensity based Infrared 3-D depth mechanism. For example, Microsoft Kinect is a manifestation of such demands for more affordable and real time 3-D depth sensing. In this paper, we investigate currently available 3-D sensor technologies for comparison followed by the presentations of the results in novel mono-vision based 3-D surface sensing and visualization study. The novel method presented in this paper is to calculate the 3-D depth and the surface angle of an object at the same time. The proposed technology is to generate high quality 3-D surfaces with a pure intensity matrix from multiple light sources. The enabling technology is the multiple intensity differentiation method, which is the main focus of study in the paper.},

It has been shown that the effect of long-term exposure to humidity will accelerate the decrease in mechanical properties and long-term strength of wood and wood-based products. The most commonly used methods for studying the deterioration of the mechanical properties of wood and wood-based products under the action of long-term humidity exposure are artificially accelerated aging and outdoor exposure. Many scholars have studied various artificially accelerated aging tests, which can accelerate the aging of wood and wood-based products and save substantial time. However, the results of outdoor exposure tests can be better correlated with the aging of the materials in the actual environment. Scholars have established a relationship between artificially accelerated aging tests and the results of outdoor exposure tests and have studied the results of outdoor exposure tests under different climatic conditions. This paper not only reviews the artificially accelerated aging tests used for wood and wood-based products in the past twenty years, but also summarizes their characteristics and application scope. In addition, the relationship between the outdoor exposure tests and the artificially accelerated aging tests is reviewed.

  abstract = {The discussion in this chapter begins in Section 10.2 with some general considerations of metal mirrors as distinguished from nonmetallic ones. A variety of examples of metal mirror design and fabrication techniques are then discussed. Mirrors made of various materials are considered in Sections 10.3 through 10.5. Because of the inherent porosity of some metal surfaces, it is advantageous to plate them with an amorphous material. Electrolytic and electroless nickel are very common types of plating for such mirrors. In Section 10.6, the characteristics of these types of plating and descriptions of their applications are summarized. Some, but not all, of the metals discussed here are compatible with material removal and final contouring to optical-quality surfaces by precision turning with single-point, gem-quality natural diamond tools. This process, commonly called single-point diamond turning (SPDT), is discussed in Section 10.7. In Sections 10.8 and 10.09, some of the techniques most commonly used to mount metal mirrors in optical instruments are discussed. It is quite feasible to interface many smaller metallic substrates with the various conventional mounts discussed earlier in this book for nonmetallic mirrors. There are design differences in such mountings because the mechanical properties of metals differ from those of nonmetals. Highly successful methods for supporting small to moderate-sized metal mirrors involve mounting provisions built into the mirrors themselves. Integral mounting techniques are reviewed, and some precautions to be observed in such designs are summarized. The chapter closes in Section 10.10 with brief considerations of multiple metallic optical and mechanical component interfaces using SPDT techniques to facilitate assembly and optical alignment.},

  abstract = {The effect of the humidity of the surrounding atmosphere on the characteristics of capacitive structures is a known problem for capacitive gas-pressure sensors. However, the use of a differential mode of operation can provide a good solution -- only the manufacturing of the ceramic structures with the appropriate pairs of capacitive sensing elements remains a major challenge. In order to find a compromise solution, the effect of the humid atmosphere and the moisture on the exterior of an LTCCbased capacitive pressure sensor was inspected closely through experimental and numerical analyses of various situations.},

  abstract = {Thermoelectric materials have drawn vast attentions for centuries, because thermoelectric effects enable direct conversion between thermal and electrical energy, thus providing an alternative for power generation and refrigeration. This review summaries the thermoelectric phenomena, applications and parameter relationships. The approaches used for thermoelectric performance enhancement are outlined, including: modifications of electronic band structures and band convergence to enhance Seebeck coefficients; nanostructuring and all-scale hierarchical architecturing to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. Several promising thermoelectric materials with intrinsically low thermal conductivities are introduced. The low thermal conductivities may arise from large molecular weights, complex crystal structures, liquid like transports or high anharmonicity of chemical bonds. At the end, a discussion of future possible strategies is proposed, aiming at further thermoelectric performance enhancements.},
