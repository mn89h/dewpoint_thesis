  abstract = {Despite the pervasiveness of the idea that arthritis is influenced by the weather, scientific evidence on the matter is sparse and non-conclusive. This study, conducted in the Australian inland city of Bendigo, sought to establish a possible relationship between the pain and rigidity of arthritis and the weather variables of temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed and precipitation. Pain and rigidity levels were scored by 25 participants with osteoarthritis and/or rheumatoid arthritis four times per day for 1 month from each season. Mean pain and rigidity scores for each time of each day were found to be correlated with the meteorological data. Correlations between mean symptoms and temperature and relative humidity were significant (P {$<$}0.001). Time of day was included in the analysis. Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that meteorological variables and time of day accounted for 38\% of the variance in mean pain and 20\% of the variance in mean rigidity when data of all months were considered. A post-study telephone questionnaire indicated 92\% of participants perceived their symptoms to be influenced by the weather, while 48\% claimed to be able to predict the weather according to their symptoms. Hence, the results suggest (1) decreased temperature is associated with both increased pain and increased rigidity and (2) increased relative himidity is associated with increased pain and rigidity in arthritis sufferers.},

  abstract = {Relative humidity is usually measured in aerological observations and dew point depression is usually reported in upper-air reports. These variables must frequently be converted to other moisture variables in meteorological analysis. If relative humidity is converted to vapor pressure, most humidity variables can then be determined. Elliott and Gaffen reviewed the practices and procedures of the US radiosonde system. In their paper, a comparison of the relative errors was made between the saturation vapor pressure formulations of Tetens (1930), Goff-Gratch (1946), Wexler (1976), and Buck (1981). In this paper, the authors will expand the analysis of Elliott and Gaffen by deriving several new saturation vapor pressure formulas, and reviewing the various errors in these formulations. They will show that two of the new formulations of vapor pressure over water and ice are superior to existing formulas. Upper air temperature data are found to vary from about +50 C to \{minus\}80 C. This large variation requires a saturation vapor pressure equation to be accurate over a large temperature range. While the errors introduced by the use of relatively inaccurate conversion equations are smaller than the errors due to the instruments, dewpoint coding errors, and dewpoint conversion algorithms (Elliott and Gaffen, 1993); they introduce additional systematic errors in humidity data. The most precise formulation of vapor pressure over a plane surface of water was given by Wexler (1976). The relative errors of Tetens` (1930) formula and one due to Buck (1981) (Buck`s equation is recommended in the Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 3, 1991) are shown. The relative errors in this table are the predicted value minus the Wexler value divided by the Wexler value.},

  abstract = {An important factor for comfort ratio in the indoor environment and affecting human health and well-being is the relative humidity. Studies have shown that about 70\% of the staff at Swedish offices, schools and kindergartens experiences that the air is too dry during the winter season. Studies show that the relative humidity in indoor environments influences the incidence of respiratory infections and allergies. Important factors for the air environment indoors is to limit the number of airborne particles, since these are conveyors of both bacteria and viruses, and to keep the humidity at a level above 40\% and below 70\%, making the survival of viruses and bacteria minimized. Measurement results show that there is significant difference in the relative humidity during the winter season between the mechanically ventilated buildings with relative humidity levels below 10\% than in buildings with natural ventilation. An important issue is how human health is affected by during longer periods and during much of the day live in environments with low relative humidity. Several researchers have noted that the incidence of respiratory infections increase during the winter when people are exposed to long periods of low humidity indoors. This means that the consequences of low humidity in the indoor environment should be considered and evaluated in a completely different way than is done today.},

Below 45\% relative humidity at 20–22 °C almost no house dust mites are able to survive, but at higher humidities the number of mites increases rapidly up to several thousand mites per gram house dust. Humid indoor conditions also favour the growth of fungi indoors. About 60\% of all cases of newly diagnosed house dust mite asthma are due to a heavy exposure to house dust mites caused by high indoor humidities. Preventive measures are reduction of the indoor generated water vapour and higher ventilation rates. The size of the latter should not be fixed, but be adapted to keep indoor humidities so low that the growth of allergens is not favoured.},

  abstract = {The effect of the Knudsen layer in the thermal micro-scale gas flows has been investigated. The effective mean free path model has been implemented in the open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, to extend its applicability up to slip and early transition flow regime. The conventional Navier-Stokes constitutive relations and the first-order non-equilibrium boundary conditions are modified based on the effective mean free path, which depends on the distance from the solid surface. The predictive capability of the standard ‘Maxwell velocity slip—Smoluchwoski temperature jump’ and hybrid boundary conditions ‘Langmuir Maxwell velocity slip—Langmuir Smoluchwoski temperature jump’ in conjunction with the Knudsen layer formulation has been evaluated in the present work. Simulations are carried out over a nano-/micro-scale backward facing step geometry in which flow experiences adverse pressure gradient, separation and re-attachment. Results are validated against the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) data, and have shown significant improvement over the existing CFD solvers. Non-equilibrium effects on the velocity and temperature of gas on the surface of the backward facing step channel are studied by varying the flow Knudsen number, inlet flow temperature, and wall temperature. Results show that the modified solver with hybrid Langmuir based boundary conditions gives the best predictions when the Knudsen layer is incorporated, and the standard Maxwell-Smoluchowski can accurately capture momentum and the thermal Knudsen layer when the temperature of the wall is higher than the fluid flow.},

  abstract = {It was found for two species that net carbon dioxide uptake rates were reduced at constant intercellular carbon dioxide partial pressure when single attached leaves were exposed to large leaf to air water vapour pressure differences. Leaf temperature, irradiance, and ambient carbon dioxide and oxygen partial pressures were kept constant. Net carbon dioxide uptake rates decreased linearly with increasing vapour pressure difference, even in cases where transpiration rates were highest at intermediate values of vapour pressure difference. Decreases in net carbon dioxide uptake rates were quickly reversible. Different wind speeds across the measured leaf, different vapour pressure deficits around the rest of the shoot, and transient responses of net carbon dioxide uptake rate to abrupt changes in vapour pressure difference all gave the same response of net carbon dioxide uptake rate to vapour pressure difference. The data show that the inhibition of net carbon dioxide uptake rate at a given vapour pressure difference was not simply related to whole leaf transpiration rate or stomatal conductance.},

  abstract = {Deliqueszenz (lateinisch deliquescere, zerfließen) ist der Vorgang, bei dem eine wasserlösliche Substanz, die feuchter Luft ausgesetzt ist, Feuchte aus der Luft aufnimmt und eine Lösung bildet, sobald die Luftfeuchte über einem für die Substanz charakteristischen Grenzwert liegt. Wenn aus der Umgebungsluft genügend Feuchtigkeit aufgenommen werden kann, zerfließt die Substanz dabei vollständig zur Lösung. Insbesondere unterliegen alle wasserlöslichen Salze der Deliqueszenz. Der Phasenübergang (Gas-Flüssigkeit) auf einem hygroskopischen Stoff bzw. auf einer hygroskopischen Lösung ist streng genommen keine Kondensation, sondern eine "Physisorption". In diesem Artikel wird der Zusammenhang mit dem allgemein geläufigeren Begriff der Kondensation erklärt werden. Die relative Feuchte, oberhalb welcher Deliqueszenz eintritt, ist die für die Substanz charakteristische Deliqueszenzfeuchte. Sie ist identisch mit der relativen Gleichgewichtsfeuchte über einer gesättigten Lösung der betreffenden Substanz in Wasser. Liegt die aktuelle relative Luftfeuchte darüber, liegt auch der Wasserdampf-Partialdruck der Luft über dem Gleichgewichtsdampfdruck der entstandenen Lösung, es liegt Übersättigung vor und Luftfeuchte kondensiert auf der bestehenden Lösung. Liegt umgekehrt die aktuelle relative Luftfeuchte unter der Deliqueszenzfeuchte, verdunstet Wasser aus der Lösung und ein Teil der gelösten Substanz kristallisiert wieder aus („Effloreszenz“). bzw. („Fällung“). Die Deliqueszenzfeuchte kann je nach Art der Substanz zwischen Werten nahe 0 \% und Werten nahe 100 \% liegen.},

Micromachining, more commonly known as MEMS or microelectromechanical systems, is an enabling technology based upon standard semiconductor manufacturing. MEMS technology makes possible solid-state sensors with greatly reduced power consumption and low operating voltage that are fully compatible with digital electronics and can be manufactured in high volumes at low cost. A water vapor microsensor just becomes another part on the circuit board. A "technology roadmap" for water vapor microsensors is defined where the sensing technologies have been organized into four major transduction schemes: capacitive, mass-sensitive, optical and resistive. Sensing element type, key geometric features and excitation scheme provides further classification. Operating principles and general performance characteristics are also presented.},

  abstract = {Abstract The influence of land surface heterogeneity on potential cloud formation is investigated using relative humidity as an indicator. This is done by performing numerical experiments using a large-eddy simulation model (LES). The land surface in the model was divided into two patches that had the same sum of latent and sensible heat flux but different Bowen ratios to simulate heterogeneous land surfaces. For heterogeneity in the meso-γ scale (2–20 km), sensitivity analyses were carried out on the heterogeneity amplitude (Bowen ratio difference between contrasting areas) and the inversion strength of potential temperature and specific humidity. The competition between absolute temperature decrease by ABL growth and dry air entrainment in heterogeneous conditions is analyzed using the LES results. First, it is shown that entrainment is located and enhanced over patches with higher Bowen ratios (warm patches) than their surroundings (cold patches). The heterogeneity-induced strong thermals can further penetrate the inversion at the ABL top, thereby reaching lower absolute temperatures than in homogeneous conditions. Second, because of the heterogeneity-induced circulations the moisture is located over the warm patch, and higher time-averaged RH values at the ABL top (RHzi) than over the cold patches are found here, even for dry atmospheres. These RHzi exceed values found over homogeneous land surfaces and are an indication that surface heterogeneity may facilitate cloud formation. In vertical profiles of RH, few differences are found between the homogeneous and heterogeneous cases, but the essential heterogeneity-induced modifications are within the domain variability.},

Despite its significance, relatively scant work is reported in the open literature on the model-assisted optimization of fuel cells. In this paper, a methodology for model-based optimization is presented by considering a one-dimensional nonisothermal description of a fuel cell operating on reformate feed. The numerical model is coupled with a continuous search simulated annealing optimization scheme to determine the optimum solutions for selected process constraints. Optimization results are presented over a range of fuel cell design parameters to assess the effects of membrane thickness, electrode thickness, constraint values, and CO concentration on the optimum operating conditions.},

In this work, we elucidate the local corrosion mechanism of the ENIG-Cu system by applying microscopic, surface analysis and electrochemical techniques with high spatial resolution to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex local corrosion mechanism of the ENIG-Cu system. The corrosion initiation is highly localised and associated with pores or micro-defects in the Au layer. The corrosion initiates by the dissolution of the underlying Ni layer, being less noble than Au. The dissolution propagates in lateral and perpendicular directions relative to the surface in an elliptical fashion. With time, the direction of corrosion propagation changes to a predominantly lateral attack of the Ni layer. The corrosion process is governed by the cathode/anode ratio of the Au/Ni galvanic couple.},

  abstract = {Evaporation is the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas or vapor, and is a key step in Earth’s water cycle. At the molecular level, evaporation requires breaking at least one very strong intermolecular bond between two water molecules at the interface. Despite the importance of this process the molecular mechanism by which an evaporating water molecule gains sufficient energy to escape from the surface has remained elusive. Here, we show, using molecular dynamics simulations at the water-air interface with polarizable classical force field models, that the high kinetic energy of the evaporated water molecule is enabled by a well-timed making and breaking of hydrogen bonds involving at least three water molecules at the interface, the recoil of which allows one of the molecules to escape. The evaporation of water is thus enabled by concerted, ultrafast hydrogen-bond dynamics of interfacial water, and follows one specific molecular pathway.},

This guard cell response to CO2 acclimatizes to the environmental conditions on the transfer of plants between the two environments. In the present study, air relative humidity is identified as a key environmental factor mediating the changes in stomatal sensitivity to CO2. In the greenhouse environment, elevation of relative humidity to growth chamber levels resulted in an enhanced CO2 response, whereas a reduction in the light level to that comparable to growth chamber conditions had no effect on stomatal CO2 sensitivity. The transfer of plants between humidified and normal greenhouse conditions resulted in an acclimation response with a time‐course matching that previously obtained in transfers of plants between greenhouse and growth chamber environments. The high stomatal sensitivity to CO2 of growth chamber‐grown plants could be reduced by lowering growth chamber relative humidity and then restored with its characteristic acclimation time‐course by an elevation of relative humidity. Leaf temperature was unchanged during this restoration, eliminating it as a primary factor in the acclimation response. Humidity regulation of stomatal CO2 sensitivity could function as a signal for leaves inside dense foliage canopies, promoting stomatal opening under low light, low CO2 conditions.},

It has been shown that the effect of long-term exposure to humidity will accelerate the decrease in mechanical properties and long-term strength of wood and wood-based products. The most commonly used methods for studying the deterioration of the mechanical properties of wood and wood-based products under the action of long-term humidity exposure are artificially accelerated aging and outdoor exposure. Many scholars have studied various artificially accelerated aging tests, which can accelerate the aging of wood and wood-based products and save substantial time. However, the results of outdoor exposure tests can be better correlated with the aging of the materials in the actual environment. Scholars have established a relationship between artificially accelerated aging tests and the results of outdoor exposure tests and have studied the results of outdoor exposure tests under different climatic conditions. This paper not only reviews the artificially accelerated aging tests used for wood and wood-based products in the past twenty years, but also summarizes their characteristics and application scope. In addition, the relationship between the outdoor exposure tests and the artificially accelerated aging tests is reviewed. At the end of the paper, the challenges and prospects for the future works are put forward.},
