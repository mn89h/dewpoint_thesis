In this review paper we will attempt to present the various contributions made for the sampling theorems with the necessary mathematical details to make it self-contained. We will begin by a clear statement of Shannon's sampling theorem followed by its applied interpretation for time-invariant systems. Then we will review its origin as Whittaker's interpolation series. The extensions will include sampling for functions of more than one variable, random processes, nonuniform sampling, nonband-limited functions, implicit sampling, generalized functions (distributions), sampling with the function and its derivatives as suggested by Shannon in his original paper, and sampling for general integral transforms. Also the conditions on the functions to be sampled will be summarized. The error analysis of the various sampling expansions, including specific error bounds for the truncation, aliasing, jitter and parts of various other errors will be discussed and summarized. This paper will be concluded by searching the different recent applications of the sampling theorems in other fields, besides communications theory. These include optics, crystallography, time-varying systems, boundary value problems, spline approximation, special functions, and the Fourier and other discrete transforms.},

  abstract = {This chapter provides the introductory information on piezoelectric energy harvesting covering various aspects such as modeling, selection of materials, vibration harvesting device design using bulk and MEMS approach, and energy harvesting circuits. All these characteristics are illustrated through selective examples. A simple step-by-step procedure is presented to design the cantilever beam based energy harvester by incorporating piezoelectric material at maximum stress points in first and second resonance modes. Suitable piezoelectric material for vibration energy harvesting is characterized by the large magnitude of product of the piezoelectric voltage constant (g) and the piezoelectric strain constant (d) given as (d· g). The condition for obtaining large magnitude of d·g has been shown to be as |d| =εn, where ε is the permittivity of the material and n is a material parameter having lower limit of 0.5. The material can be in the form of polycrystalline ceramics, textured ceramics, thin films, and polymers. A brief coverage of various material systems is provided in all these categories. Using these materials different transducer structures can be fabricated depending upon the desired frequency and vibration amplitude such as multilayer, MFC, bimorph, amplified piezoelectric actuator, QuickPack, rainbow, cymbal, and moonie. The concept of multimodal energy harvesting is introduced at the end of the chapter. This concept provides the opportunity for further enhancement of power density by combining two different energy-harvesting schemes in one system such that one assists the other.},

Mike Tooley provides all the information required to get to grips with the fundamentals of electronics, detailing the underpinning knowledge necessary to appreciate the operation of a wide range of electronic circuits, including amplifiers, logic circuits, power supplies and oscillators. The 5th edition includes an additional chapter showing how a wide range of useful electronic applications can be developed in conjunction with the increasingly popular Arduino microcontroller, as well as a new section on batteries for use in electronic equipment and some additional/updated student assignments. The book's content is matched to the latest pre-degree level courses (from Level 2 up to, and including, Foundation Degree and HND), making this an invaluable reference text for all study levels, and its broad coverage is combined with practical case studies based in real-world engineering contexts. In addition, each chapter includes a practical investigation designed to reinforce learning and provide a basis for further practical work. A companion website at http://www.key2electronics.com offers the reader a set of spreadsheet design tools that can be used to simplify circuit calculations, as well as circuit models and templates that will enable virtual simulation of circuits in the book. These are accompanied by online self-test multiple choice questions for each chapter with automatic marking, to enable students to continually monitor their own progress and understanding.

  abstract = {The idea of wireless power transfer (WPT) has been around since the inception of electricity. In the late 19th century, Nikola Tesla described the freedom to transfer energy between two points without the need for a physical connection to a power source as an "all-surpassing importance to man". A truly wireless device, capable of being remotely powered, not only allows the obvious freedom of movement but also enables devices to be more compact by removing the necessity of a large battery. Applications could leverage this reduction in size and weight to increase the feasibility of concepts such as paper-thin, flexible displays, contact-lens-based augmented reality, and smart dust, among traditional point-to-point power transfer applications. While several methods of wireless power have been introduced since Tesla's work, including near-field magnetic resonance and inductive coupling, laser-based optical power transmission, and far-field RF/microwave energy transmission, only RF/microwave and laser-based systems are truly long-range methods. While optical power transmission certainly has merit, its mechanisms are outside of the scope of this article and will not be discussed.},

  abstract = {Modeling and Design of Electromagnetic Compatibility for High-Speed Printed Circuit Boards and Packaging presents the electromagnetic modelling and design of three major electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) issues related to the high-speed printed circuit board (PCB) and electronic packages: signal integrity (SI), power integrity (PI), and electromagnetic interference (EMI). The emphasis is put on two essential passive components of PCBs and packages: the power distribution network and the signal distribution network. This book includes two parts. Part one talks about the field-circuit hybrid methods used for the EMC modeling, including the modal method, the integral equation method, the cylindrical wave expansion method and the de-embedding method. Part two illustrates EMC design methods and explores the applications of novel metamaterials and two-dimensional materials on traditional EMC problems. This book is designed to enhance worthwhile electromagnetic theory and mathematical methods for practical engineers and to train students with advanced EMC applications.},
