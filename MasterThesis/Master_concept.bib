  abstract = {An infrared heating lamp has been used as the driving force in laboratory experiments simulating the thermohaline circulation of the world ocean. The radiative energy from the lamp absorbed at different depths in the laboratory tank, as well as the possible temperature effects, have been calculated. The results demonstrate that in the laboratory more than 50 \% of the infrared radiation is absorbed within the upper 0.01 mm, more than 90 \% within the upper 0.1 mm, and more than 99 \% within the upper 1 mm, and that evidently most of the heat energy in the surface layer is quickly transported away by other physical processes.},

Design/methodology/approach Following an introduction, this paper first identifies the major gas sensing technologies and provides an overview of optical sensing techniques. The sources and impact of the gases most frequently sensed by optical methods are listed. Three non-absorption-based and nine absorption-based methods and their main applications are then described in detail. Brief concluding comments are drawn. Findings All manner of optical gas sensing techniques have been commercialised and while the majority are absorption-based, several other methods also play a significant role. Some optical gas sensors offer advanced capabilities such as remote monitoring, the creation of 2D and 3D distribution maps, detection of parts per trillion levels and even the visualisation of gases in real time. They play a vital role in protecting workers from hazardous gases, controlling and minimising air pollution and monitoring the atmospheric environment, as well as being used in the food, medical, process, power generation and other industries.

  abstract = {In recent years, thermoelectric cooling technology (TECT) has emerged as one of high efficiency and low energy consumption methodologies for electronic cooling. This paper presented a comprehensive survey of TECT to show a complete foundation on the thermoelectric applications in electronic cooling. Thermoelectric physical parameters, consisting of Seebeck coefficient S, thermal conductivity K, and electric resistance R, are highly dependent on temperatures of thermoelectric heating and cooling sides and they have been simplified into constants when the thermoelectric cooling model was theoretically established. Furthermore, two systematical solution methodologies were proposed, i.e., the thermal resistance network and the effectiveness-number of transfer units, to describe the coefficient of performance (COP). Effects of cooling load, air temperature and all thermal conductances in heating side on the cooling performance have been attempted, regarding surface temperature of electronic devices and COP as evaluation indexes. Our analysis reveals that thermal control for electronics of high heat flux could be achieved by enhancing heat transfer in the hot side of thermoelectric system and increasing the numbers of thermoelectric coolers. Overall, governing parameters and modeling for practical applications have been presented, and the cooling potential of thermoelectric technology for electronic devices could be enhanced further.},

As it is a known fact that they wish to remain in their own home for as long as possible, solutions must be designed to detect these diseases automatically, limiting the reliance on human resources. To this end, our team developed a sensors platform based on infrared proximity sensors to accurately recognize basic bathroom activities such as going to the toilet and showering. This article is based on the body of scientific literature which establish evidences that activities relative to corporal hygiene are strongly correlated to health status and can be important signs of the development of eventual disorders. The system is built to be simple, affordable and highly reliable. Our experiments have shown that it can yield an F-Score of 96.94\%. Also, the durations collected by our kit are approximately 6 seconds apart from the real ones; those results confirm the reliability of our kit.},

In addition, preparation and characterization of sensing materials are also described.

  abstract = {Although ubiquitous in nature and industrial processes, transport processes at the interface during evaporation and condensation are still poorly understood. Experiments have shown temperature discontinuities at the interface during evaporation and condensation but the experimentally reported interface temperature jump varies by two orders of magnitude. Even the direction of such temperature jump is still being debated. Using kinetic-theory based expressions for the interfacial mass flux and heat flux, we solve the coupled problem between the liquid and the vapor phase during evaporation and condensation. Our model shows that when evaporation or condensation happens, an intrinsic temperature difference develops across the interface, due to the mismatch of the enthalpy carried by vapor at the interface and the bulk region. The vapor temperature near the interface cools below the saturation temperature on the liquid surface during evaporation and heats up above the latter during condensation. However, many existing experiments have shown an opposite trend to this prediction. We explain this difference as arising from the reverse heat conduction in the vapor phase. Our model results compare favorably with experiments on both evaporation and condensation. We show that when the liquid layer is very thin, most of the applied temperature difference between the solid wall and the vapor phase happens at the liquid-vapor interface, leading to saturation of the evaporation and the condensation rates and the corresponding heat transfer rate. This result contradicts current belief that the evaporation and condensation rates are inversely proportional to the liquid film thickness.},

Results highlight the existence of a first regime with a roughness exponent of 0.95 and a fractal dimension (DF) of the nickel film about 2.05.

The FPH record from Boulder, Colorado, is the longest continuous stratospheric water vapor record. The instrument has an uncertainty in the stratosphere that is {$<$} 6 \% and up to 12 \% in the troposphere. A digital microcontroller version of the instrument improved upon the older versions in 2008 with sunlight filtering, better frost control, and resistance to radio frequency interference (RFI). A new thermistor calibration technique was implemented in 2014, decreasing the uncertainty in the thermistor calibration fit to less than 0.01 °C over the full range of frost – or dew point temperatures (−93 to +20 °C) measured during a profile. Results from multiple water vapor intercomparisons are presented, including the excellent agreement between the NOAA FPH and the direct tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer (dTDLAS) MC-PicT-1.4 during AquaVIT-2 chamber experiments over 6 days that provides confidence in the accuracy of the FPH measurements. Dual instrument flights with two FPHs or an FPH and a cryogenic frost point hygrometer (CFH) also show good agreement when launched on the same balloon. The results from these comparisons demonstrate the high level of accuracy of the NOAA FPH.},

  abstract = {Human knowledge of infrared (IR) radiation is about 200 years old. However it was in the late 20th century that we developed a wide range of smart technologies for detection and started to take advantage for our benefit. Today IR detector technology is in its 3rd generation and comes with challenging demands. Based on the propagation of IR radiation through free space it is divided into different transmission windows. The most interesting for thermal imaging are the mid-wave IR (MWIR) and the long-wave IR (LW IR). Infrared detectors for thermal imaging have a number of applications in industry, security, search \& rescue, surveillance, medicine, research, meteorology, climatology and astronomy. Currently high-performance IR imaging technology is mainly based on epitaxially grown structures of the small-bandgap bulk alloy mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT), indium antimonide (InSb) and GaAs based quantum-well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs), depending on the application and wavelength range. However, they operate at low temperatures requiring costly and bulky cryogenic systems. In addition there is always a need for better performance, which generates possibilities for developing new technologies. Some emerging technologies are quantum dot infrared photodetectors (QDIPs), type-II strained layer super-lattice, and QDIPs with type-II band alignment. In this report a brief review of the current and new technologies for high performance IR detectors, will be presented.},

Optical detectors also fall under two categories: point detectors that merely detect light intensity and two-dimensional detectors including position sensors and image sensors. In general, optical detectors utilizing the external photoelectric effect are represented by photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and exhibit fast time response and high sensitivity.

  abstract = {Interdroplet vapor pressure gradients are the driving mechanism for several phase-change phenomena such as condensation dry zones, interdroplet ice bridging, dry zones around ice, and frost halos. Despite the fundamental nature of the underlying pressure gradients, the majority of studies on these emerging phenomena have been primarily empirical. Using classical nucleation theory and Becker–Döring embryo formation kinetics, here we calculate the pressure field for all possible modes of condensation and desublimation in order to gain fundamental insight into how pressure gradients govern the behavior of dry zones, condensation frosting, and frost halos. Our findings reveal that in a variety of phase-change systems the thermodynamically favorable mode of nucleation can switch between condensation and desublimation depending upon the temperature and wettability of the surface. The calculated pressure field is used to model the length of a dry zone around liquid or ice droplets over a broad parameter space. The long-standing question of whether the vapor pressure at the interface of growing frost is saturated or supersaturated is resolved by considering the kinetics of interdroplet ice bridging. Finally, on the basis of theoretical calculations, we propose that there exists a new mode of frost halo that is yet to be experimentally observed; a bimodal phase map is developed, demonstrating its dependence on the temperature and wettability of the underlying substrate. We hope that the model and predictions contained herein will assist future efforts to exploit localized vapor pressure gradients for the design of spatially controlled or antifrosting phase-change systems.},

  abstract = {Aiming at solving the problem of atmospheric humidity measurement, a new dew point sensor using quartz crystal without frequency measurement has been developed. The sensor is composed of the Peltier module and the quartz crystal. When active condensation begins to occur in the quartz crystal surface, the electrical characteristics of the quartz crystal will change. Consequently, the oscillation characteristics of the resonant circuit containing the quartz crystal will also change. Hence, the oscillation characteristics change can be used to identify the time of condensation. The cessation of oscillation was measured, due primarily to signal attenuation caused by dew formation. This method uses the sensitive properties of quartz crystal but with no frequency measurement and also exploit the stability of the circuit. The sensor we have developed has fast response time and recovery time, especially with excellent dehumidifying performance. The accuracy of the dew point sensor when compared with the MICHELL S4000 dew point meter is found to be ±0.3°C DP in the range of −20°C to 20°C DP.

  abstract = {Water vapor condensation is a ubiquitous process in nature and industry. Over the past century, methods achieving dropwise condensation using a thin ({$<$}1 µm) hydrophobic “promoter” layer have been developed, which increases the condensation heat transfer by ten times compared to filmwise condensation. Unfortunately, implementations of dropwise condensation have been limited due to poor durability of the promoter coatings. Here, thin-film condensation which utilizes a promoter layer not as a condensation surface, but rather to confine the condensate within a porous biphilic nanostructure, nickel inverse opals (NIO) with a thin ({$<$}20 nm) hydrophobic top layer of decomposed polyimide is developed. Filmwise condensation confined to thicknesses {$<$}10 µm is demonstrated. To test the stability of thin-film condensation, condensation experiments are performed to show that at higher supersaturations droplets coalescing on top of the hydrophobic layer are absorbed into the superhydrophilic layer through coalescence-induced transitions. Through detailed thermal-hydrodynamic modeling, it is shown that thin-film condensation has the potential to achieve heat transfer coefficients approaching ≈100 kW m−2 while avoiding durability issues by significantly reducing nucleation on the hydrophobic surface. The work presented here develops an approach to potentially ensure durable and high-performance condensation comparable to dropwise condensation.},

An operating envelope is developed to characterize the TEC based thermal management system for peak and off peak operating conditions. Parametric studies were performed to analyze the effect of the number of TEC module(s) in the system, geometric factor of the thermo-elements and the cold to hot side thermal resistances on the system performance. The results showed that there is a tradeoff between the extent of off peak heat fluxes and ambient temperatures when the system can be operated at a low power penalty region and the maximum capacity of the system.},

  abstract = {Conventional Electroless Nickel/Immersion Gold (ENIG) currently available in the market is prone to brittle solder joints failures. Due to these reasons, there are field failures and reliability concerns of electronic assemblies-component disconnection which lead to overall malfunction of electronic assemblies. The novel ENIG achieves robust solder joints and provides improved quality and reliability of electronic assembly. Also, it uses cyanide-free chemistry for the immersion gold process making it eco-friendly. This allows manufacturers to consume eco-friendly product while avoiding major field failures and resulting consequences. With conventional ENIG, the immersion gold process operates on galvanic displacement process (displacing Ni atoms by Au atoms). If not controlled properly, the displacement can be aggressive leading to Ni corrosion, commonly known as "black pad" or hyper-corrosion of Ni. This leads to brittle solder joints failures. Also, during the reflow process the gold layer dissolves into solder and intermetallics form between tin and nickel. In conventional ENIG intermetallics, too much nickel diffuses into tin leaving behind soft Ni3P layer at the interface. This soft layer is responsible for brittle solder joints failures. The novel ENIG employs an interfacial engineering approach which leads to 10X corrosion resistance of Ni surface helping to prevent black pad/hyper-corrosion. Also, it creates a barrier for Ni atoms to diffuse too much in tin forming distinct-thin intermetallics which are robust and eliminates brittle solder joints failures. Ball Shear and Ball Pull tests (Industry Standard Based testing: JESD22-B115 \& JESD22-B117) have been conducted after (1, 3 and 6) reflow cycles during the soldering process. Also, as a part of simulating aging and evaluating long term reliability of solder joints/electronic assemblies, samples were subjected to 150°C for 500 hours and 1000 hours before conducting Ball shear test and Ball Pull test. The novel ENIG board surface finish achieves robust solder joints for better reliability of electronic assemblies.},

We present an analysis showing that limiting values of Kw(λ) can be estimated from aw(λ) and vice versa.

Semiconductor lasers are now preferred over gas and solid-state lasers due to their wide tuning rage, high wall plug efficiency, compactness, low cost, and reliability. Unlike gas lasers there is a strong dependence of the local refractive index on the carrier density in semiconductor lasers, which affect mode discrimination and beam quality severely in a diode laser. For modern semiconductor laser designs, improved crystal quality meant reduced propagation losses and decreased thermal resistance as the lasers could now be made thinner, broader, and longer without compromising on the crystal quality. Modern semiconductor lasers use variants of the SCH design and the active regions are generally undoped. Recombination of injected carriers resulting in spontaneous emission is a major route to carrier loss in semiconductor lasers.},

  abstract = {The dew point is the temperature at which vapour begins to condense out of the gaseous phase. The deterministic relationship between the dew point and humidity is the basis for the industry-standard “chilled-mirror” dew point hygrometers used for highly accurate humidity measurements, which are essential for a broad range of industrial and metrological applications. However, these instruments have several limitations, such as high cost, large size and slow response. In this report, we demonstrate a compact, integrated photonic dew point sensor (DPS) that features high accuracy, a small footprint, and fast response. The fundamental component of this DPS is a partially exposed photonic micro-ring resonator, which serves two functions simultaneously: 1) sensing the condensed water droplets via evanescent fields and 2) functioning as a highly accurate, in situ temperature sensor based on the thermo-optic effect (TOE). This device virtually eliminates most of the temperature-related errors that affect conventional “chilled-mirror” hygrometers. Moreover, this DPS outperforms conventional “chilled-mirror” hygrometers with respect to size, cost and response time, paving the way for on-chip dew point detection and extension to applications for which the conventional technology is unsuitable because of size, cost, and other constraints.},

Depth sensing of human body motions can promote intuitive gesture inputs for natural HMI (Human Machine Interface) as well as HRI (Human Robot Interaction) to the next level. In today's industry, the dominant trends in 3-D depth sensing are shifting from the traditional laser based scanning or TOF (Time of Flight) depth sensing to the intensity based Infrared 3-D depth mechanism. For example, Microsoft Kinect is a manifestation of such demands for more affordable and real time 3-D depth sensing. In this paper, we investigate currently available 3-D sensor technologies for comparison followed by the presentations of the results in novel mono-vision based 3-D surface sensing and visualization study. The novel method presented in this paper is to calculate the 3-D depth and the surface angle of an object at the same time. The proposed technology is to generate high quality 3-D surfaces with a pure intensity matrix from multiple light sources. The enabling technology is the multiple intensity differentiation method, which is the main focus of study in the paper.},

  abstract = {The discussion in this chapter begins in Section 10.2 with some general considerations of metal mirrors as distinguished from nonmetallic ones. A variety of examples of metal mirror design and fabrication techniques are then discussed. Mirrors made of various materials are considered in Sections 10.3 through 10.5. Because of the inherent porosity of some metal surfaces, it is advantageous to plate them with an amorphous material. Electrolytic and electroless nickel are very common types of plating for such mirrors. In Section 10.6, the characteristics of these types of plating and descriptions of their applications are summarized. Some, but not all, of the metals discussed here are compatible with material removal and final contouring to optical-quality surfaces by precision turning with single-point, gem-quality natural diamond tools. This process, commonly called single-point diamond turning (SPDT), is discussed in Section 10.7. In Sections 10.8 and 10.09, some of the techniques most commonly used to mount metal mirrors in optical instruments are discussed. It is quite feasible to interface many smaller metallic substrates with the various conventional mounts discussed earlier in this book for nonmetallic mirrors. There are design differences in such mountings because the mechanical properties of metals differ from those of nonmetals. Highly successful methods for supporting small to moderate-sized metal mirrors involve mounting provisions built into the mirrors themselves. Integral mounting techniques are reviewed, and some precautions to be observed in such designs are summarized. The chapter closes in Section 10.10 with brief considerations of multiple metallic optical and mechanical component interfaces using SPDT techniques to facilitate assembly and optical alignment.},

  abstract = {Thermoelectric materials have drawn vast attentions for centuries, because thermoelectric effects enable direct conversion between thermal and electrical energy, thus providing an alternative for power generation and refrigeration. This review summaries the thermoelectric phenomena, applications and parameter relationships. The approaches used for thermoelectric performance enhancement are outlined, including: modifications of electronic band structures and band convergence to enhance Seebeck coefficients; nanostructuring and all-scale hierarchical architecturing to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. Several promising thermoelectric materials with intrinsically low thermal conductivities are introduced. The low thermal conductivities may arise from large molecular weights, complex crystal structures, liquid like transports or high anharmonicity of chemical bonds. At the end, a discussion of future possible strategies is proposed, aiming at further thermoelectric performance enhancements.},
